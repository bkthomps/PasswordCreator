# PasswordCreator
Creates a randomized password.

### Setup
* Clone the repository
* You can add some aliases to your bashrc for convenience
```
alias genpass='~/ShellProjects/PasswordCreator/create_password.sh'
alias gen='genpass 1 1 1 1 25'
```
* Reload your bashrc with `source ~/.bashrc`
* Now you can call genpass to call the script, and you can call gen to generate a strong password

### Check Strength
